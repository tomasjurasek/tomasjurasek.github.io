I'm a software developer, architect, and consultant based in Brno. 

I try to understand complex distributed systems and how to build long-lived, easily extensible products.

I'm the organizer of [Domain-Driven Design Meetups Brno](https://www.meetup.com/domain-driven-design-meetups-brno/), where people share their experiences building complex systems.

The topics with which I can help:
* Microservices
* Domain-Driven Design
* Event Sourcing
* CQRS
* Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture
* .NET Architecture & things around .NET


Feel free to contact me by [e-mail](mailto:jurasek.tomas@gmail.com).
